For example, some investigators have argued convincingly that pneumococcal vaccination is ineffective in adults and that the apparent benefits in preventing pneumonia in the respective meta-analysis (seemingly larger in less developed countries) are entirely spurious. <xref>76</xref>

"Several clinical criteria and decision tools have been developed to assist clinicians in identifying which febrile children have a serious illness. Unfortunately these have either not been externally validated in independent datasets, do not perform consistently, have insufficient accuracy, or apply only to a limited age range. <xref>8</xref>

Importantly the traffic light system missed a sizeable proportion of urinary tract infections. This is a substantial deficiency in a screening tool for serious bacterial infections in febrile young children, given that, after the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, the prevalence of occult bacteraemia in febrile children presenting to emergency departments has decreased substantially to somewhere between 0.4% and 0.7%, <xref>28</xref> whereas the prevalence of urinary tract infection in children with fever without a clinically obvious source remains greater than 7%. <xref>29</xref>

"The NICE fever guidelines advise routine testing of urine in all children with fever without apparent source (including those who are in the green zone of the traffic light system), thus helping to avoid missed cases of urinary tract infections, but they do not include this test in the traffic light system itself. <xref>21</xref>
<xref>30</xref> Based on our findings, we strongly support this recommendation but suggest that urine analysis be added to the traffic light criteria."

"In this context, one can view successful programs aimed at preventing rehospitalization‚Äîsuch as the Care Transitions Program, and the Transitional Care Model‚Äîas attempts to strengthen the support systems and the self care capacity of patients at greatest risk. <xref>33</xref>

The newer starches with molecular weights of 130 kDa and substitution ratios ranging from 0.38 to 0.45 have been claimed to be safer, but the data to support this are insufficient. <xref>4</xref>

"Four trials reported serious adverse events, two of which registered these during the entire stay on the intensive care unit. <xref>9</xref>
<xref>11</xref>
<xref>53</xref>
<xref>54</xref> In the 6S trial serious adverse events were restricted to severe bleeding and severe allergic reactions, <xref>9</xref> whereas CRYSTMAS used broad criteria. <xref>11</xref> The last two trials did not specify the definition of serious adverse events, and one of them had zero events in 24 hours follow-up. <xref>54</xref>"

The recent large, well designed trials showed consistent results with no statistical heterogeneity and the findings are likely to be confirmed when further data of the patients with sepsis in the Crystalloid versus Hydroxyethyl Starch (CHEST) trial <xref>10</xref> become available, since the hydroxyethyl starch group in this trial had more use of renal replacement therapy and transfusion with red blood cells and more serious adverse events.

Adjustment methodologies that assume that a diagnosis made in Miami, Manhattan, or Los Angeles contains the same information as one made in Minneapolis, Seattle, or Salt Lake City are guilty of what one author labeled the constant risk fallacy: the assumption that the underlying relations between case mix variables and outcomes are constant across populations or over time. <xref>35</xref>
